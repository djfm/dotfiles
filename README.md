Here are my main dotfiles, useful to keep my computers in sync and save time.

# Setup

## General

Symlink all dotfiles in here to home directory and follow
other relevant instructions in this document.

## Tmux

Install the [Tmux Plugin Manager](https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tpm):

```
git clone https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tpm ~/.tmux/plugins/tpm
```

## Git

Don't forget to download and install [delta](https://github.com/dandavison/delta)

# TODO

Create a script that automates all of this setup and the application of changes thereof.
